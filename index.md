We think that technology, data and the internet are the keys to unlocking a revolution in the way that people get involved in their communities and join in with the charities and causes that they care about.

We believe everybody in society has something to contribute, so we're focusing on how digital innovation and [platform thinking](http://www.wired.com/2014/01/platform-thinking-approach-innovation/) can redefine social problems and make radical new solutions possible.



## How we work

SCVO Labs is part of the [Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations](http://www.scvo.org.uk). Unlike other projects, we're structured and [run like a startup](http://theleanstartup.com/principles). This gives us the space we need to move fast, to try new things and to give our users our complete attention.

We're inspired by those who put bravery and creativity before playing it safe, and who won't settle for 10 per cent better when 10 times better is possible. And with a bit of luck, we're [just crazy enough](http://www.wired.com/2013/02/moonshots-matter-heres-how-to-make-them-happen/) to succeed.

Sharing is caring, so you'll find insights from what we're up to on [our blog](/blog/).
