## We're starting a participation revolution by doing good with new technologies.

We think that technology, data and the internet are the key to unlocking a revolution in the way that people get involved in their communities and join in with the charities and causes that they care about.

We believe everybody in society has something to contribute, so we're focusing on how [platform thinking](http://www.wired.com/2014/01/platform-thinking-approach-innovation/) can redefine social problems and make radical new solutions possible.

We know that the best way to make change happen is to stop talking and start doing, so we're developing some exciting new digital products with huge potential to do good. The first of these are currently in stealth mode whilst we take the first steps on design and prototyping.

### How we work

We're part of the [Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations](http://www.scvo.org.uk). Unlike other projects, we're structured and [run like a startup](http://theleanstartup.com/principles). This gives us the space we need to try new things and to give our users our complete attention.

We're inspired by those who put bravery and creativity before playing it safe, and who won't settle for 10 per cent better when 10 times better is possible.

We like to think big, start small and move fast.

And with a bit of luck, we're [just crazy enough](http://www.wired.com/2013/02/moonshots-matter-heres-how-to-make-them-happen/) to have a shot at succeeding.

### Internships

We have an exciting opportunity for someone with an interest in how digital tools can be used for social good to join us on a six-week paid internship. You'll help us to research and review existing social tech ventures, and map out how people and organisations are already using the web, games and apps to support good causes around the world.

This opportunity is part of a wider SCVO employability and business growth programme. To find out more about our opportunity please visit the [programme page](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/internships/), click the "view vacancies" button, and then use the keyword **SCVO**.

### Join us

We're on the lookout for talented people.

You'll need to be entrepreneurial, a great team player, and passionate about the creative application of technology, data and the internet to solve social problems.

In return you'll get to work with motivated, like-minded peers and help build products that will make a real difference to people's lives.

We'd love to hear from people with expertise in:

- Full stack web development, including [PHP](http://php.net/), [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) and front end frameworks
- [Linked data](http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) and the [semantic web](http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/)
- [UX design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design) and research
- Community engagement and outreach

We don't need you to have years and years of formal experience, but we do need you to have a track record of creating great digital products or services. This could be in a business context, as part of your studies, or simply projects that you have undertaken in your own time.

To talk about opportunities please [contact our director](mailto:chris.yiu@scvo.org.uk). You might like to include URLs for your profiles on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com), [GitHub](https://github.com) or other relevant networks, along with some examples of recent work or projects that you're particularly proud of.

### Support our work

We're looking for support from organisations that share our passion for doing good with new technologies. You might be able to provide seed and / or growth funding for our ventures, come on board as a technology partner, or provide support in kind to help us grow. Interested? [Get in touch](mailto:chris.yiu@scvo.org.uk).

### Partner with us

We're hugely excited by all of the fantastic activity that is springing up in the social tech space. We believe that making things open makes them better, and want to find ways for the things we build to work well with other tools and platforms. If you already run a digital product or service and would like to talk about interoperability then please [get in touch](mailto:chris.yiu@scvo.org.uk).

### Advisory board

We're assembling a small group of advisors to guide our overall strategy and execution. If you have substantive experience as an entrepreneur, digital professional or third sector leader and are looking for a new way to put your experience to good use then we would be delighted to talk to you. Want to find out more? [Get in touch](mailto:chris.yiu@scvo.org.uk).
