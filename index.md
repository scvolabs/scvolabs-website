We think that technology, data and the internet are the keys to unlocking a revolution in the way that people get involved in their communities and join in with the charities and causes that they care about.

We believe everybody in society has something to contribute, so we're focusing on how digital innovation and [platform thinking](http://www.wired.com/2014/01/platform-thinking-approach-innovation/) can redefine social problems and make radical new solutions possible.



## How we work

SCVO Labs is part of the [Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations](http://www.scvo.org.uk). Unlike other projects, we're structured and [run like a startup](http://theleanstartup.com/principles). This gives us the space we need to move fast, to try new things and to give our users our complete attention.

We're inspired by those who put bravery and creativity before playing it safe, and who won't settle for 10 per cent better when 10 times better is possible. And with a bit of luck, we're [just crazy enough](http://www.wired.com/2013/02/moonshots-matter-heres-how-to-make-them-happen/) to succeed.

Sharing is caring, so you'll find insights from what we're up to on [our blog](/blog/).



## Products

### [Good HQ](https://goodhq.org): A feedback platform for charities and good causes

_The current status of this product is: **pre-release**._

<img src="/images/mockup1.png" class="mockup" alt="" /> <img src="/images/mockup2.png" class="mockup" alt="" />

Good HQ is a feedback platform for charities and good causes in Scotland. We want to make it easier for people to talk about their experiences with charities and good causes, to celebrate all the good things that are happening in civil society in Scotland, and share authentic, meaningful and open feedback as a way to encourage improvement. By enabling this, we also hope to make it easier for others to find out about charities and good causes they might be interested in, and to see what people are saying about them.

Please note sign up is currently restricted to a limited number of pre-approved users. We'll post an update here as soon as our public alpha release is live.
