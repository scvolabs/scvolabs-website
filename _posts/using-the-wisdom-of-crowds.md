The wisdom of the crowds - the collective opinion of a group of individuals rather than that of a single expert – is not a new concept.  It’s been around since Aristotle.

In recent years, technology has changed our ability to aggregate collective opinions which has changed our behaviour, most notably for how we make purchasing decisions.

Whether it's Amazon, eBay, tripadvisor or any other site with feedback and ratings, most people now check out reviews before purchasing or booking something.

A recent [BBC article] http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33205905 quoted some fascinating statistics:

> *62% of British consumers say they are likely to be affected by positive online reviews - with negative ones, that soars to 89%.*

> *One in sixteen of the people online across the world visited TripAdvisor last July. The website gains 139 reviews each minute*

Reviews and rating have become big business.  Apparently there is a new industry of writing fake reviews positively and negatively about organisations and services.

Even crowd-sourced encyclopaedia, Wikipedia, has had its integrity called into question with fake data.  Earlier this year Tory MP Grant Shapp was accused of creating a fake identity to edit his own Wikipedia page.  http://metro.co.uk/2015/04/22/tory-mp-accused-of-creating-fake-online-identity-to-edit-his-own-wikipedia-page-5161085/

Even though I know there can be fake reviews, I still read them.  It’s become part of my decision making process before purchasing goods, even when I am not buying online. There is a certain amount of conscious and subconscious filtering but reviews most definitely influence my behaviour.

Giving feedback online on products and services I have purchased has also become part of my psyche.  I love the fact the openness of the internet and fast feedback through public reviews influences retailers and service providers to improve and change behaviour.

Feedback via the internet has turned on its head the old studies that showed  that a satisfied customer will tell 2-3 people about their experience. A dissatisfied consumer will share their experience  with 8-10 people and some even reach beyond 20.

Organisations now have to be responsive to feedback and be seen to promptly implement learning because complaints can quickly go viral.

Even feedback through traditional means like letters can go viral.  One of my favourite examples is the 2008 Letter to Richard Branson http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/4344890/Virgin-the-worlds-best-passenger-complaint-letter.html.  Still appearing in full in mainstream newspaper articles last year.
 
Giving and receiving feedback openly is now part of so many aspects of our lives – I feel a kind of duty to participate when I have something to say so I add my wisdom to the crowd to help others.  

Is this part of the participation revolution?  How could we better harness the power of feedback for charities and voluntary organisations?
