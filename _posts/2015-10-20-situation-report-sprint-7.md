Here's the latest roundup of progress over the last fortnight.

There's been a brief hiatus since the last post, as we've also moved across Edinburgh to a new home at Hayweight House on Lauriston Street. This gives us more room for whiteboards and problem-solving, and as an added bonus we're just round the corner from [Codebase](http://www.thisiscodebase.com/) and [Code Clan](http://codeclan.com/).

#### Done (technical):

* Lots of work behind the scenes to improve performance, testing and extensibility
* Added postcode fields and geocoding for users
* Added on-page reporting for problems / bugs
* Improved control over user profiles
* Improved flagging / moderation controls

#### Done (non-technical):

* Further UX and content design work
* Onboarded about 50 test users

#### Next:

* Open site up for users to browse without signing in
* Set up admin console and facility to moderate content
* Improve email templates and content design
* Add ability to browse by local authority area
* Add trending content to the site
