Here's the latest roundup of progress over the last fortnight.

We deployed a [new, stable pre-release build of the platform](https://goodhq.org) and have begun gathering user feedback. The user-generated content on the platform is still test data at this stage; in a couple of week's time we will reset the database so it's ready for live use.

If we've been in touch to offer you early access to explore the platform then you can [activate your account](https://goodhq.org/#/signup/) at any time. 

#### Done (technical):

* Customisable header images on profile pages
* Improved homepage layout
* Improved search
* Improved error messaging
* Improved email handling
* Fixed caching and performance issues in Internet Explorer :s
* Integrated Google Analytics with the on-site dashboard

#### Done (non-technical):

* Content and UX design throughout the site
* Added contextual information relevant to the current release
* Show and tell with interested parties
* Set up a batch of dummy accounts to illustrate how the platform will work

#### Next:

* Implement more granular location information, mapping and search
* Implement additional user account controls (e.g. recover password)
* Make it easier for users to report errors or missing features
* Improve the new user onboarding process
* Link missing features to analytics so we can monitor interest
