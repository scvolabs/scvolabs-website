Many of the tools we use in our daily work would cost a vast amount of money if we were a commercial organisation. Thanks to good-will towards non-profit organisations we are able to use wonderful tools at discounted rates or completely for free. 

In addition to open source software and libraries, we are able to achieve a lot without having to deal with large invoices - we hope this list will help other charities discover new tools and do more with less.

Most of these organisations will need proof of your charitable status - it should be enough to link to your profile with [OSCR](http://www.oscr.org.uk/charities/search-scottish-charity-register) (in Scotland) or the [Charity Commission](http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/showcharity/registerofcharities/RegisterHomePage.aspx) (in rUK). 

## Team collaboration

### Slack

This is a fast and functional team messaging platform that allows group and private messaging - we use it with different "channels" for different projects.

Slack offers non-profit organisations a standard account for free. As it is a per-user pricing model, this saves us over Â£1,000 annually!

### Trello 

Trello is an amazing free-form task management system that I could write a whole blog post about (I might add that to my Trello TODO list!)

Trello offer a 30% discount on their [Business](https://trello.com/business-class) per-user pricing model which offers greater flexibility, administrative controls, and features such as integrations with other services. You'll need to contact their billing department directly to request a discount code.

We use GitHub to store our code repositories. They a discount to non-profit organisations matching the price of the bronze account which allows for private code repositories - we use this for [IP development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property) and internal documentation, as well as the public respositories for open-source projects.
