#### Done (technical):

* Implemented sign up by email
* Implemented editable profile pages for users
* Implemented up and down voting for content items
* Implemented on site alerts
* Set up [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)
* A whole bunch of UX and UI refinements

#### Done (non-technical):

* Initial content design / branding
* Product review and discussion with colleagues
* Concept introduction with some interested parties
* Further iteration of strategy template and business model canvas 

#### Next:

* Map key user journeys to inform product development
* Set up admin panel to support next phase of testing
* Open sandbox environment and accounts for a small number of test users
