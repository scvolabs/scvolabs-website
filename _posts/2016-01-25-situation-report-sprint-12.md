Here's the latest roundup of progress on the project, and our first big post of 2016. It's also going to be one of my last, as I will be leaving SCVO soon to pursue new challenges elsewhere. The project is in great shape and we are all set to launch our public beta in a couple of weeks, so the best is yet to come!


### Sprint 11

#### Done (technical):

* Added new feature for users to post short content items to their own page
* Improved URL structure to better match our underlying data structure and APIs
* Assorted code optimisations and refactoring
* Added ability to link Good HQ user pages to vacancy information from [Goodmoves](http://www.goodmoves.org.uk/)
* Overhauled the graph visualisation tool to improve performance and stability

#### Done (non-technical):

* New splash page with better product information and call to action
* Clearer highlighting of search terms on results page
* Improve search page layout and filtering controls



### Sprint 12

#### Done (technical):

* Implemented a much more robust and usable image picker
* Improved the underlying data structure to enable faster data visualisations
* Rationalised and decomissioned some old development databases
* Added `alt` tags for all images on the site
* Added additional counts and metrics to the administration view

#### Done (non-technical):

* Added product images to splash page
* Added FAQs based on early user feedback
* Improved navigation controls for mobile users
* Added a new "organiser / participant" switch for user profiles
* Added an option to immediately hide feedback on your own page
* More early adopter information sessions



#### Next:

There is going to be some unavoidable hiatus over the next few weeks, as I depart and new people join the team to help take things to the next level. In the meantime [Alex](https://twitter.com/ANuttgens) and [Lucy](https://twitter.com/LucyMcTernan) will be holding the fort, and using the time to consolidate work to date and think about the future.

On the to-do list, then:

* Deliver product tweaks on the basis of user feedback
* Prepare for beta release at [The Gathering](http://gatherscotland.org.uk/) on 17/18 February
* Strengthen the team by recruiting for a new community manager role
* Review and consolidate our hosting, storage and compute infrastruture
* Pay back technical debt!
* Undertake R&D work for longer-term features
