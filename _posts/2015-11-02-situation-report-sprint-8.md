This is something of a milestone update: our alpha product is close to feature complete, and we are now accepting signups from anyone who is interested in taking the product for a spin. Head over to the [Good HQ](https://goodhq.org) homepage, hit *sign up* to get started, and then let us know how you get on!

#### Done (technical):

* Set open access to site content (users must still sign in to interact)
* Added trending users to homepage
* Improved user control over notifications and email updates
* Upgraded underlying database performance
* Lightweight sharing buttons optimised for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+
* Admin console for moderating content
* New back-end and front-end unit tests

#### Done (non-technical):

* Lots of content design and streamlining across the site
* Migrated our product backlog to Trello (user stories are still on the whiteboard, though!)
* Further work on business plan and go-to-market strategy

#### Next:

* Bug and feature fixes in response to user needs
* Better integration with email services for broadcast messages
* Meeting early adopters to talk about use cases and structured testing
