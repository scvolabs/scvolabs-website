A big (the biggest?) part of running an agile project is a commitment to ship working code on a regular basis. We're now through the very early set-up phase for the project and have settled into a cadence that feels right for us: a fortnightly sprint cycle with major versions deployed every other Friday.

From here on out on I'll post an update after each sprint with a summary of what's done and what's next. Technically the last couple of weeks were Sprint 2, so on this occasion I'll recap Sprint 0 and Sprint 1 for the record.

### Sprint 0

Done (technical):

* Proof-of-concept running on a local and remote [LAMP stack](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10060285/what-is-a-lamp-stack)
* Explored / evaluated [Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) environment
* Explored / evaluated [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) environment

Done (non-technical):

* First pass at our strategy template and business model canvas

### Sprint 1

Done (technical):

* Refactored front end using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/)
* Abstracted database calls to an API layer
* Initialised a project repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (private for now)
* Deployed a prototype version to a test environment

Done (non-technical):

* Reviewed existing platforms for (a) reviews / ratings and (b) charities / good causes
* First iteration of user personas

### Sprint 2

Done (technical):

* Refactored back end using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* Migrated from a relational database to a [graph database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database)
* Implemented sign in via [Twitter / OAuth](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth)
* Migrated CSS to [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and implemented first visual design
* Acquired a production domain and implemented [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)
* Deployed a pre-release version to a production environment

Done (non-technical):

* Iterated our strategy template and business model canvas
* Second iteration of user personas
* Fieldwork with general public on core concept

Next:

* Face-to-face conversations with various stakeholders to get their input and reactions to the pre-release product
* A whole bunch of refinements, bug fixes and stress-testing on the product to get it ready for an Alpha release
* Prep for further rounds of user research and user testing

Our lead developer is off on (well deserved) leave for a week now, so we've got a short hiatus before Sprint 3 begins later this month.
